# Covecube-Scraper

A semi-simple script that will fetch and dowload al lof the installers for the StableBit products from Covecube Inc. 
This skips existing installers and only downloads new ones. However, it will always upate the changes.txt file, so the change log is always up to date.

This powershell script was created to create an "onsite repo" for myself, but could be used by anyone.
